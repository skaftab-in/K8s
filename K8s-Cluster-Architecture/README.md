# Kubernetes Cluster Architecture

Welcome to the Kubernetes Cluster Architecture section of the repository. Here, you'll find an overview of the components that make up a Kubernetes cluster, along with a detailed explanation of how they interact to manage containerized workloads.

## Introduction

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a control plane that manages the state of the cluster, and worker nodes that run the containerized applications. This structure enables Kubernetes to efficiently orchestrate, scale, and maintain applications in a cloud-native environment.

### Key Components

- **Control Plane:** Manages the cluster's state, schedule workloads, and handle communication between components.
- **Worker Nodes:** Execute the containerized applications and handle network communications.

For a more detailed explanation, please refer to the [Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md) document.
